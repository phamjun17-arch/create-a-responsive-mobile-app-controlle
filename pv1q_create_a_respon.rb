# Responsive Mobile App Controller Notebook

# Requirements
# ============

# 1. Design a controller that can detect the device type (mobile or desktop)
# 2. Adjust the app's layout and styling based on the device type
# 3. Implement responsive design principles to ensure a seamless user experience

# Controller Class
# ==============

class ResponsiveMobileAppController
  def initialize
    # Initialize device detection
    @device_type = detect_device_type
  end

  def detect_device_type
    # Device detection logic
    # For demonstration purposes, we'll use a simple user agent check
    ua = UserAgent.new(request.user_agent)
    if ua.device.mobile?
      :mobile
    else
      :desktop
    end
  end

  def adjust_layout
    # Adjust layout and styling based on device type
    case @device_type
    when :mobile
      # Mobile-specific layout and styling
      @layout = 'mobile'
      @styling = 'mobile_css'
    when :desktop
      # Desktop-specific layout and styling
      @layout = 'desktop'
      @styling = 'desktop_css'
    end
  end

  def render_view
    # Render the view with the adjusted layout and styling
    render @layout, stylesheet: @styling
  end
end

# Usage
# ====

# Create an instance of the controller
controller = ResponsiveMobileAppController.new
